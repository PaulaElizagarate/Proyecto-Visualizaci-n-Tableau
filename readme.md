# Tableau Project: Demographic Data around the World

This Tableau project visualizes demographic data from around the world, including birth rates, cost of living, and pollution levels. The data was extracted, cleaned, and transformed into Tableau-compatible dataframes using the Pandas library.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project was obtained from a variety of sources, including:

- [Expansi√≥n Natalidad](https://datosmacro.expansion.com/demografia/natalidad?anio=2021).
